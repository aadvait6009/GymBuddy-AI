Bicep Curl Counter: Your New Workout Buddy
Hey! ðŸ‘‹

So, I put together this cool little project that I thought you might like. Itâ€™s an AI-powered Bicep Curl Counter that uses your webcam to count your reps as you work out. Yep, no more trying to keep track in your headâ€”let the computer do it for you!

Whatâ€™s the Deal?
Imagine this: youâ€™re doing your bicep curls, and as you move, the app is right there with you, counting each rep and even showing you the angle of your elbow. Itâ€™s super simple but also kinda neat. Perfect if youâ€™re into fitness and tech like me.

What Youâ€™ll Need
Before you get started, hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:

Python 3.7 or higher: This is the programming language weâ€™re using. If you donâ€™t have it, no worriesâ€”itâ€™s easy to install.
A webcam: Youâ€™ll need this so the app can "see" you. If youâ€™re on a laptop, you probably already have one. If not, any basic external webcam will do.
Getting Set Up
Grab the Code:
First things first, you need to download the project. If you know how to use Git, run this:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aadvait6009/GymBuddy-AI.git
cd GymBuddy-AI
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Handy):
This step isnâ€™t required, but itâ€™s a good idea if you want to keep things tidy, especially if you have other Python projects. Hereâ€™s how:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the Goodies:
Now, youâ€™ll want to install all the necessary libraries. Itâ€™s super easyâ€”just run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use It
Fire It Up:
Time to get things rolling. Just run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python bicep_curl_counter.py
Pick Your Arm:
A little window will pop up asking whether youâ€™re working out your left or right arm. Click your choice, and youâ€™re all set.

Start Curling:
Now, just do your thing! As you curl, the app will count your reps and show you the angle of your elbow. Itâ€™s like having a little coach in your computer.

Finish Up:
When youâ€™re done, just press the ` key (backtick) on your keyboard to close the app. Easy peasy.

Whatâ€™s Inside?
Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of whatâ€™s in the project:

bicep_curl_counter.py: This is the main script that makes everything work.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python libraries you need to install.
Background.png: The background image for the loading screen.
load.gif: A fun GIF that plays while the app is loading.
